#### KEY NOTES
- ##### Function should be small and smaller than that
- ##### Extract into function till you drop
- ##### Function should do one thing only and do it well

##### Guide lines
- Function should be small, 20 - 30 lines 
- Function shouldn't manipulate more than one abstraction
- Extract common code and use oops to break down large functions

#### 
- Smaller functions + descriptive names are easier to reason about
- Large funtions are places where classses hide
- Function call overhead is non existent in present systems [except embedded env]
- Functions that have common params, can be cleaned up using OOPS
